## Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1.	Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the current working directory.
2.	Load both the training and test datasets, keeping only columns which reflect mean or standard deviation
3.	Load the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset.
4.	Merge the datasets.
5.	Convert the “activity” and “subject” columns into factors
6.	Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file secTidySet.txt.
